    // 1 Read from Workbook
    //   1.1 Consider some options like  
            // 1.1.1 Does it have a specific sheet?
            // 1.1.2 Does it have a header?
            // 1.1.3 Does it need to read specific columns?
            // 1.1.4 Do the columns have different names than the object it wants to save?
      //  1.2 Consider mapping what columns to be extracted in the object/DTO
      //  1.3 Consider if the mapping should use an explicit type or dynamic

    // 2 Transform the data
    //   2.1 Make it as intuitive as making it a fluent approach
      //   2.2 Make it easy to define rules or how the data is transformed or mapped
         
  // 3 Load data to the defined object
